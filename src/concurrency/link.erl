% A process which will wait 5 seconds before dying.

proc() ->
    timer:sleep(5000),
    exit(reason).

% A method for spawning process above.

spawn_parent_proc() ->
    Pid = spawn(fun proc/0),
    link(Pid).

% Same as above but safer (linking is done atomically so we avoid
% situations like process dying before it's even linked)

spawn_parent_proc_atomically() ->
    Pid = spawn_link(fun proc/0),
    link(Pid).

% After process dies, process which are linked with it will receive
% it's "death signal" which will be propagated throughout the chain

chain(0) ->
    receive
        _ -> ok
    after 2000 ->
        exit("chain dies here")
    end;

chain(N) ->
    Pid = spawn(fun () -> chain(N - 1) end),
    link(Pid),
    receive
        _ -> ok
    end.
